### Module Installation

1. Module: This code uses Python's built-in `calendar` module. Since it comes with Python, there's no need to install it separately.

### Purpose of the Code

The code displays a calendar for a specific month and year that the user inputs. 

### How the Code Works

1. Converting Month Name to Number:
   — The `calendar` module has a feature to list the names of the months. The code uses this feature to convert a month name (like "July") into a month number (like 7). This conversion is necessary because the `calendar` module requires the month to be specified as a number when generating a calendar.

2. User Input:
   — The code prompts the user to enter a month and year in a specific format, such as "July, 2024".

3. Processing the Input:
   — The input string is split into two parts: the month name and the year. The month name is then converted into a month number using the previously defined conversion function.

4. Displaying the Calendar:
   — The code then uses the `calendar` module to print out the calendar for the specified month and year.

### How to Use the Code

— When you run the program, it will ask you to enter a month and a year.
— You need to type the month name followed by the year, separated by a comma and a space (e.g., "July, 2024").
— The program will then display the calendar for that month and year.

This simple program demonstrates how to interact with users, process input, and use a Python module to display useful information.
