1. Modules to Install:
   — `playsound`: This is an external module used to play sound files. You'll need to install it using a package manager like pip. You can install it with the command `pip install playsound`.

2. Purpose of the Code:
   — The code creates a simple alarm clock. It lets you set an alarm time and will play a sound when the current time matches the alarm time.

3. How It Works:
   — Setting the Alarm:
     — When you run the program, it asks you to input the time for the alarm. You need to enter this time in a 12—hour format (like 7:30 PM).
     — The program then tries to convert this input into a time format that it can work with. If the input is in the correct format, it saves the alarm time; if not, it asks you to try again until the format is correct.

   — Running the Alarm Clock:
     — Once the alarm time is set, the program prints out the time when the alarm is set to go off.
     — The program then enters a loop where it continuously checks the current time.
     — It compares the current time with the set alarm time. If the current time matches the alarm time, it prints a message indicating that the alarm is ringing and plays a sound (specified in the `alarm_sound.mp3` file).
     — The program then stops after playing the sound.

   — Waiting and Checking Time:
     — While waiting for the alarm time to match, the program pauses briefly (10 seconds) before checking the time again. This prevents the program from continuously running without breaks.

This code sets an alarm based on user input, waits for the specified time, and then plays a sound to alert the user when the alarm goes off. It uses the `datetime` module to handle time and the `playsound` module to play the alarm sound.
