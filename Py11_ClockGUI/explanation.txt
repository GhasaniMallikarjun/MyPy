### What You Need to Install
This code uses the `tkinter` library, which is a built-in Python module for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). If you are using a standard Python installation, you typically don't need to install `tkinter` separately, as it comes included with Python.

### What This Code Does
The code creates a simple digital clock application using a GUI. Here's how it works:

1. Importing Necessary Modules: 
   — `tkinter` is imported with an alias `tk` for creating the GUI elements.
   — The `time` module is imported to work with time-related functions.
   — The `font` module from `tkinter` is imported as `tkfont` to customize the appearance of text in the GUI.

2. Updating the Time: 
   — A function called `update_time` is defined to get the current time using the `time` module and update the text displayed in the GUI. This function uses a 12—hour format (with AM/PM) for the time display.
   — The `time.strftime()` function formats the current time into a string.
   — The `time_label.config()` method updates the displayed time in the GUI.
   — The `after()` method is used to call the `update_time` function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second), which refreshes the displayed time continuously.

3. Creating the Main Window:
   — The main window of the application is created using `tk.Tk()`, which initializes a new Tkinter window.
   — The title of the window is set to "Digital Clock".
   — The size of the window is set to 800 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.
   — The background color of the window is set to purple.

4. Customizing the Time Display:
   — A custom font is created using `tkfont.Font()`, specifying the font family, size, and weight. In this case, the font family is "DS-Digital", which mimics the appearance of digital clocks.
   — A label (`time_label`) is created to display the time. The label uses the custom font and has a blue background and white text.
   — The label is packed into the main window using the `pack()` method, which organizes the label to expand and fill the available space.

5. Starting the Application:
   — The `update_time()` function is called once to initialize the display with the current time.
   — The `root.mainloop()` method starts the main event loop of the application, which waits for user interactions and updates the GUI as needed. This loop continues running until the application is closed.

This code sets up a digital clock display in a window that continuously updates every second to show the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM indication.
